    "1. TFDV Exploration: we will start by exploring the fundamentals of tfdv.\n",
    "2. Data validation: next we will write some *tests* for our data.\n",
    "3. Drift detection: and finally, we will simulate *drift* in our data by introducing *bugs* in our serving data & check if tfdv is able to catch this for us!\n",
    "4. (Optional) fix data bug: if time permits, we will also try to implement a fix for the data bug.\n",
